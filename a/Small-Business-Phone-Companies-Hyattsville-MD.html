<p>Still, with so much choice available, and with a lot lingo surrounding the subject of office telephones, it can be difficult to know where to start. While Digital Phone Systems are practical and convenient; they're not mobile. Nevertheless, if your business should abide by security guidelines that need information to be stored on-site, then a hosted option is probably not the best option.

Since the voice signal is broken up into data packets as an IP call, spread over the internet, and reassembled at its destination (kind of like a Star Trek transporter), rather than binding a copper peer-to-peer landline circuit, phone calls are less expensive through VoIP-- another cost savings point. Rather of using telephone lines, VoIP utilizes SIP trunks (SIP represents session initiation protocol).</p>
